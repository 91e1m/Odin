/**
 * # Animatable
 *
 * The animatable constraint allows you to easily implement animations that'll appear exactly how you wanted them to.
 *
 * It works by animating between 2 different [Constraints][Constraint] provided, swapping between each when animated.
 *
 * If you need an animating constraint, where you need to animate to any point, look at [Animatable.Raw]
 *
 * @see Animatable.Raw
